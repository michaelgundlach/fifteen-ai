slow is path calc - but what part?

create new info nodes for boards as i go, which point to parents.
if the board already exists, great - it was from a shorter route and created earlier.

generate nodes 5 deep from the root, and keep track of the leaves.
when you choose one step down from the root, ask the leaves to generate kids.
then you have your full knowledge of the 5-deep new tree.
